CASE STUDY
We want to build a Feedback Form application where employees can share their feedback (like
“MileStone2 Completed – Yes/No” or “Training quality”, etc.).
Instead of duplicating logic (like input validation, logging, or authentication) across different forms,
we will use Higher Order Components (HOCs) to manage these cross-cutting concerns in a
reusable way.
