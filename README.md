=>CASE STUDY
We want to build a Feedback Form application where employees can share their feedback (like
“MileStone2 Completed – Yes/No” or “Training quality”, etc.).
Instead of duplicating logic (like input validation, logging, or authentication) across different forms,
we will use Higher Order Components (HOCs) to manage these cross-cutting concerns in a
reusable way.

=>CASE STUDY
case study is to build a Book Explorer app that fetches books from the Gutendex API and lets users search by title/author, filter by language, and sort by popularity.

I am doing this by using React state + useEffect to fetch data, then applying filtering, searching, and sorting logic before displaying books in cards.
